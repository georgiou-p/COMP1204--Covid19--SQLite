# COVID-19 Data Management Coursework

## Overview

This coursework involves creating a SQLite database to represent Coronavirus data from an open data source, and performing analysis on this data.
It was compeleted as part of my BSc Computer Science, Module: COMP1204, at the University of Southampton.

The tasks include:

1. **The Relational Model**:
   - Define the relation and assign data types.
   - Identify functional dependencies, candidate keys, and primary key.

2. **Normalisation**:
   - Identify partial-key and transitive dependencies.
   - Decompose the relation to achieve 2nd and 3rd Normal Form, and then Boyce-Codd Normal Form.

3. **Modelling**:
   - Import the dataset into SQLite.
   - Create and populate normalized tables.

4. **Querying**:
   - Write SQL queries to analyze the data, such as total cases and deaths, data for specific countries, and cumulative statistics.

### Dataset

The dataset to be used is the COVID-19 data from the EU Open Data Portal, available at: [Dataset CSV](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-daily-new-cases-covid-19-eueea-country).

### Submission

Submited a LaTeX report (`report.pdf`) detailing the process and findings, along with SQL scripts for each task.
